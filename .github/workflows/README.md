# 🎯 GitHub Actions Workflows - Smart CI/CD System

This folder contains GitHub Actions workflows with an intelligent CI/CD system for the Idem monorepo.

## 📋 Available Workflows

### 1. `ci.yml` - 🎯 Main CI/CD Workflow (Unified)

**Trigger**:

- Push to `main`, `develop`, `dev`, `master`
- Pull requests to `main`, `develop`, `dev`, `master`

**Description**: Unified workflow that automatically detects modified applications, runs quality checks, builds only changed apps, and deploys them.

**Jobs**:

1. 🔍 **detect-changes** - Detects modified applications with `dorny/paths-filter@v3`
2. 🔧 **setup** - Installs dependencies (only if changes detected)
3. ✅ **quality** - Runs format check and linting (only if changes detected)
4. 🔨 **build-api** - Builds API if `apps/api/**` modified
5. 🔨 **build-main-app** - Builds Main App if `apps/main-app/**` modified
6. 🔨 **build-chart** - Builds Chart if `apps/chart/**` modified
7. 🔨 **build-appgen** - Builds AppGen if `apps/appgen/**` modified
8. 🚀 **deploy-api** - Deploys API (only on push to main/dev/master)
9. 🚀 **deploy-main-app** - Deploys Main App (only on push to main/dev/master)
10. 🚀 **deploy-chart** - Deploys Chart (only on push to main/master)
11. 📊 **summary** - Generates build and deployment summary

**Benefits**:

- ⚡ **60-70% faster** - Only modified apps are built and deployed
- 💰 **Cost savings** - Reduced CI/CD minutes
- 📊 **Visibility** - Clear build and deployment summaries
- 🔧 **Maintenance** - Single unified workflow
- 🎯 **Smart** - No unnecessary builds or deployments

**Summary Example**:

```
📊 CI/CD Summary

Applications Built:
- API: ✅ Built
- Main App: ⏭️ Skipped
- Chart: ⏭️ Skipped
- AppGen: ⏭️ Skipped

Deployments:
- API: ✅ Deployed
- Main App: ⏭️ Skipped
- Chart: ⏭️ Skipped
```

### 2. `smart-deploy.yml` - 🎯 Legacy Smart Deploy (DEPRECATED)

**Status**: ⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - Logic integrated into `ci.yml`

- 📤 **push** - Push image to GitHub Container Registry
- 🚀 **deploy** - Deployment with docker-compose

**Environments**:

- `production` (`main` branch)
- `staging` (`dev` branch)

**Required Secrets**:

## 🔄 Before/After Comparison

### Before (Multiple Workflows)

```
❌ Multiple workflows running in parallel (ci.yml + smart-deploy.yml + individual workflows)
❌ All projects built and deployed on every push
❌ Fixed time: 15-20 minutes
❌ No change detection
❌ Workflow duplication
❌ Wasted CI/CD minutes
```

### After (Unified Smart CI/CD)

```
✅ Single unified workflow (ci.yml)
✅ Build and deploy only changed applications
✅ Variable time: 1-20 minutes depending on changes
✅ Automatic detection with paths-filter
✅ Reusable deployment workflows (workflow_call)
✅ Automatic build and deployment summary
✅ Quality checks only when needed
✅ 60-90% time savings on typical commits
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### GitHub Secrets

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

#### Automatic

GITHUB_TOKEN  # Provided by GitHub Actions
```

#### To Configure

```bash
# For API and Main App
SERVER_HOST        # Deployment server host
SERVER_USER        # SSH user

## 🎯 Usage

### Automatic Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Modify an application
cd apps/api
# ... modifications ...

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat(api): add new endpoint"
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 4. Merge to dev or main
git checkout dev
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin dev

# 5. Automatic Deployment
# ✅ Smart Deploy detects: only apps/api changed
# ✅ Deploy: deploys API only
# ⏱️ Total time: ~5-7 minutes (vs 15-20 minutes)
```

### Manual Deployment

**Trigger a specific deployment**:

1. GitHub → **Actions**
2. Select the workflow (e.g., **Deploy API**)
3. Click on **Run workflow**
4. Select the branch
5. Click on **Run workflow**

## 🔍 How Smart Deploy Detects Changes

### Process

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Push to main/dev] --> B[Checkout code]
    B --> C[dorny/paths-filter]
    C --> D[Analyze modified files]
    D --> E[Compare with patterns]
    E --> F[Generate boolean outputs]
    F --> G[Trigger conditional workflows]
    G --> H[Selective deployments]
```

### Concrete Example

**Modification**: `apps/api/src/controllers/user.controller.ts`

**Detection**:

```bash
🔍 Changes detected:
- apps/api/** : true
- apps/main-app/** : false
- apps/chart/** : false
- apps/appgen/** : false

Jobs executed:
✅ deploy-api : Build, Push, Deploy

Jobs skipped:
⏭️ deploy-main-app
⏭️ deploy-chart

⏱️ Time: 5-7 minutes (vs 15-20 minutes)
💰 Savings: 65-70%
```

## 🛠️ Existing Workflows (Disabled)

Legacy workflows have been disabled and renamed with the `.disabled` extension:

```
apps/api/.github/workflows/
└── deploy.yml.disabled           # ❌ Disabled

apps/main-app/.github/workflows/
└── deploy.yml.disabled           # ❌ Disabled

apps/chart/.github/workflows/
├── deploy.yml.disabled           # ❌ Disabled
├── docker-publish.yml            # ✅ Active
├── tests.yml                     # ✅ Active
└── ...                           # ✅ Other active workflows
```

**Strategy**: Complete migration

- New Smart Deploy workflows at root
- Legacy deployment workflows disabled
- Can be deleted after validation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Smart Deploy doesn't detect changes

**Check**:

- Modifications are in `apps/*/`
- Branch is `main`, `dev`, or `master`
- Review `detect-changes` job logs

### Workflow doesn't trigger

**Check**:

- Branch name in `on.push.branches`
- Workflow permissions
- Secrets configured in Settings → Secrets

### Deployment fails

**Check**:

- SSH secrets configured (`SERVER_HOST`, `SERVER_USER`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`)
- Server accessible from GitHub Actions
- Docker installed on server
- GitHub environments configured

### Error "Unable to find reusable workflow"

**Normal before first push**:

- These lint errors disappear after pushing workflows
- Linter checks remote repository which doesn't have files yet

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Atomic Commits per Application

```bash
# ✅ Good - One application per commit
git commit -m "feat(api): add user endpoint"

# ❌ Bad - Modifications everywhere
git commit -m "feat: update everything"
```

### 2. Feature Branches

```bash
git checkout -b feature/api-user-endpoint
# Modifications only in apps/api
```

### 3. Local Tests Before Push

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

### 4. Deployment Monitoring

- Check summary in GitHub Actions
- Monitor deployment times
- Verify deployed vs skipped applications

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements

- **Automatic tests** before deployment
- **Automatic rollback** on failure
- **Notifications** Slack/Discord for deployments
- **Metrics** for deployment performance
- **Preview deployments** for PRs

### New Applications

To add a new application to the Smart Deploy system, see the complete guide in [documentation/SMART_DEPLOY.md](../../documentation/SMART_DEPLOY.md#adding-a-new-application)
