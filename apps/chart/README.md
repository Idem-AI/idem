## Docker

### Run published image

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --publish 8000:8080 ghcr.io/idem-js/idem-chart
```

### To configure renderer URL

When building set the MERMAID_RENDERER_URL build argument to the rendering
service.
Example:
Default is`https://mermaid.ink`.
Set to empty string to disable PNG and SVG links under Actions

### To configure Kroki Instance URL

When building set the MERMAID_KROKI_RENDERER_URL build argument to your Kroki
instance.
Default is `https://kroki.io`
Set to empty string to disable Kroki link under Actions
